NOTE: The PIBASE.ligands server was retired in August 2015. The code is
maintained here for archiving. A mysql dump of the database is available
at https://zenodo.org/record/29588

o Using PIBASE.ligands
--------------
 For most users, the web server should prove adequate search functionality.
 If you are interested in more sophisticated queries, the database contents
 are available as a mysqldump at the website above, and you can design your
 own SQL queries.

 This package contains the software used to provide web access to the
 database. This is useful if you want to setup a PIBASE.ligands webserver.

 Installation information is described in
 docs/pibase_ligands_installation_guide.pdf


o History
---------
 PIBASE was developed at the University of California, San Francisco in the
 laboratory of Andrej Sali (http://salilab.org) and at the Janelia Research
 Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (http://janelia.org).
